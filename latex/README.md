# SISL Thesis Template

The main template file is `sisl-suthesis.sty` which depends on `tufte-stripped.sty`, `suthesis-2e.sty` and `vector.sty`. 
A preview of the template can be found in `thesis.pdf`.

Most of the math packages should already be imported in the template. Biblatex, with the tricks from the SISL wiki is also imported. 
If you think an important package or formatting rule is missing please submit an issue or a PR.
